# How to use?
1. get a copy of Plants vs. Zombies for the xbox 360.
2. Open the copy with a xbox 360 iso extractor.
3. Decompress the main.pak with xbdecompress.exe (part of the Xbox 360 SDK)
4. Open main.pak with quickbms with the specialbit.bms script
5. Navigate to the images, reanim or the particles folder.
6. Drag and Drop any .ptx file onto PtxConverter.exe

You can now open the .dds file with paint.net to either just look at it or export it to a different file format.
